# Pokenet: Pok√©mon Classifier üê±‚Äçüë§

Welcome to **Pokenet**! This is a fun little project where we use a deep learning model to classify Pok√©mon images. It's built using Fastai and Streamlit, making it super easy to use and extend.

## About the Project
Hi there! I'm Pratik, a final year BTECH student, trying get my hands aroumd deep learning with the help of Jeremy Howard's Fastai lectures. This project is a practice run to implement things that I have learned till now, Fastai makes things a lot easier compared to PyTorch alone!

### Features
- **Upload and Classify**: Simply upload an image of a Pok√©mon, and the model will tell you which one it is.
- **Easy to Use**: Built with Streamlit, so it's all GUI and no hassle.
- **Season 1 Pok√©mon**: Currently, the model can classify Pok√©mon from Season 1 only. Don't try your luck with Libre or other fancy versions!

### Disclaimer
This is a practice model and may not be perfect. Please do not upload random images that are not Pok√©mon. It only classifies Pok√©mon from Season 1.
